Capstone part I
System Architecture:
    For the development of this application, i plan to use the MERN stack with jwt authentication. My frontend will be created with React and my backend will be made with Express, because it is what i am familiar with. The user data and the stock data will be store in a Mongodb database, because of it is a non relational database.

System requirement specifications:
    When the user opens the application, they will be greeted by a login screen and a menu with an option to login or register. When the end user logs in, a page will be displayed with a list of stock items and their quantity. The use will be able to use this app to see what inventory the store has and the amount. The application will have a basic UI that will be easy to use by the end user and the admin. There will be one admin account that will be able to update the information of the products as well as add new products to the database.
